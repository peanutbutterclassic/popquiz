  - In case of incomplete quiz or no show by user, a "No score saved" notice will appear on the leaderboard.

### Features Left to Implement

- Since we are always looking to improve, any coder with a passion to promote education for all are encouraged to contribute to the following features:
  - Create a more interactive quiz that covers different areas of interest; 
  - Add more interactive sounds and technologies to the website;
  - Another feature worth including in the future is the implementation of a time system with a different game types such as racing against time;
  - A score tracking system;
  - A timer (for speed reading of contents and answering questions);
  - A ranking system to create competition and engagement with prizes for top drawer;
  - Images to support the correct/incorrect answers;
  - Users can create a username; and,
  - Feedback form.
- Other technologies to include:
  - JavaScript Libraries:
        - [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
        - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
    - Javascript framework:
        - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
    - Google Charts
    - Google Sheets

## Testing 

Testing was well documented throughout the development of this project in order to identify issues and solutions for the overall learning outcomes. 

Several notable brick walls that I have encountered during the development of this website are summarised below:
- One of the most notable issues was the glitch that occurred with the number of questions available for each quiz session which should have been 10 questions but 11 questions came up (11 out of 10). To resolve this issue, since there was no way to check javascript like HTML or CSS validator, the debugging process involved going line by line using Google Chrome Developer tool, to inspect the issue and second guessing the problem and presuming possible solutions.

2. ![Glitch identified during debugging process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/increm_error_spotted.png)
3. ![Glitch identified during debugging process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/incremental_error_fixed.png)

Although the issue was apparent, as shown in image 1, but the solution did not come immediately. Figure 2 showed that the issue occurred because of the nature of incrementation which meant [questionCounter > MAX_QUESTIONS] does not return a number less than 10. Instead, the following, as indicated in figure 3 [questionCounter === MAX_QUESTIONS], returned the right number of questions for the said issue identified in figure 1.

Another issue was identified while using Google Chrome Developer's tool during the inspection of the website. 
![Sound issue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/Sound_issue.png)

In the end, this particular issue was resolved by adding class="click" to every button that can be clicked. The javascript code is reported in script.js from line 409 to line 422. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- CSS
    - 93 errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](http://www.css-validator.org/validator#errors)

    ![CSS errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/css_errors.png)

    - Having been through several comments in different developers' forums, the issue could be ignored since most of the errors were directed to errors for em, rem, vh, and vw values. 
    ![CSS error justification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/css_validator.png)

- JavaScript
![JavaScript validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peanutbutterclassic/insync/master/assets/documentation/javascript_validator.png)

- JavaScript validation showed 47 warnings when passing through the official [Jshint validator](https://jshint.com/)
    - The following metrics were returned: 
      - There are 15 functions in this file;
      - Function with the largest signature take 2 arguments, while the median is 0;
      - Largest function has 12 statements in it, while the median is 2; and,
      - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 4 while the median is 1.
      

### Unfixed Bugs

The aim was to create a functioning quiz website. Major bugfixes have been performed and reported in the TESTING section. Considering the limited time left before the deadline, addressing and fixing the validation of CSS and Javascript errors or warnings shall be put on pending since the website is already working as expected. However, additional efforts will be allocated to improve and address issues such as favicon errors that keep popping up and error 404 when saving score in github io but the error does not persist in gitpod, which will require attention upon completion. 

In short, the quiz function well on [InSync gitpod](https://8000-white-turkey-g9merwy5.ws-eu16.gitpod.io/leaderboard.html) but an issue with 404 appear when user saves score in [InSync github deployment page](https://peanutbutterclassic.github.io/insync/end.html), which directs to error 404.

## Deployment

## Credits 

A special mention to [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s tutoring team for their support throughout my coding development. My mentor Guido has been phenomenal because he has kept encouraging me to try new things. The w3schools' resources have helped me overcome many hurdles. [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&t=3763s)' tutorial on YouTube has helped me gain knowledge on the logic behind creating a quiz through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

### Content 

- A YouTube tutorial given by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0) has helped me understand how to use modal box which I had combined with [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)'s tutorial to create my quiz page that pops up on the same page as the main page without having to use another page.
